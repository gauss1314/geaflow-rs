# Documentation Notice

This repository is now Rust-only and focuses on a production-oriented core subset of GeaFlow (vertex-centric BSP graph computing).

The content under `docs/docs-cn` and `docs/docs-en` was originally written for the Java-based GeaFlow product stack (DSL/Console/Operator, etc.) and may no longer match the code in this repository.

For the up-to-date Rust runtime usage, see:
- Chinese: [geaflow-rust/README.md](../geaflow-rust/README.md)
- English: [geaflow-rust/README_EN.md](../geaflow-rust/README_EN.md)
